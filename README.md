# Segfault-Diaries

This blog exists to document an ongoing exploration into the world of binary exploitation.

The content builds on a basic understanding of stack overflows and gradually moves into more complex areas, including topics like heap overflows, binary fuzzing, kernel exploitation, and browser internals - eventually.

Progress might be slow and uneven, but the goal is to dig deeper over time, share practical notes, and make sense of the learning process along the way.
